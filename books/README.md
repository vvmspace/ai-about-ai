- The **short editions** are tactical: fast reading, decision-ready checklists, quick refresh.
- Chapter numbers are aligned (`01..25`) across all four books for frictionless hopping.
- Short chapters link to their matching full chapter.
- Russian editions include direct links to English counterparts for side-by-side reading.

## Shared group structure (all editions)

2. Vibe Coding (`06–10`)
3. Agents (`11–15`)
