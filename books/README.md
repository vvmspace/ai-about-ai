# Books Map

A compact map of this repository’s book universe.

## Book stack

- `ai_about_ai` — full English edition (long-form).
- `ai_about_ai_ru` — full Russian edition (long-form translation/adaptation).
- `ai_about_ai_short` — short English edition (3–5x shorter chapters).
- `ai_about_ai_short_ru` — short Russian edition (3–5x shorter chapters).

## How the books connect

- The **full editions** are canonical: deep narratives, full frameworks, extended drills.
- The **short editions** are tactical: fast reading, decision-ready checklists, quick refresh.
- Chapter numbers are aligned (`01..25`) across all four books for frictionless hopping.
- Every short chapter ends with links to the matching full chapter and the counterpart short chapter in the other language.
