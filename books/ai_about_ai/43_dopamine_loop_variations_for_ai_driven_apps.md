# Dopamine Loop Variations for AI-Driven Apps

Most teams hear “dopamine loop” and think addiction gimmicks.
That’s a shallow read.

A mature dopamine loop is not manipulation.
It is structured momentum.

## Baseline loop

For AI apps, the base loop is:

1. trigger,
2. action,
3. reward,
4. next micro-commitment.

If step four is missing,
retention decays after novelty.

## Variation 1: competence loop

Best for productivity and learning products.

- Trigger: “I need help now.”
- Action: user requests assistance.
- Reward: user sees measurable improvement.
- Recommit: app suggests one slightly harder challenge.

This loop builds capability,
not dependency.

## Variation 2: progress-visibility loop

Best for long workflows.

- Trigger: user opens app with unfinished goal.
- Action: completes one small milestone.
- Reward: visible progress bar + concrete gain.
- Recommit: next milestone auto-queued.

Hidden progress kills motivation.
Visible progress compounds it.

## Variation 3: social-proof loop

Best for creator and professional communities.

- Trigger: publish generated output.
- Action: get peer reactions/benchmark.
- Reward: social validation + ranked improvement insight.
- Recommit: improve and republish.

Use carefully.
Comparison should inform,
not humiliate.

## Variation 4: uncertainty-reduction loop

Best for anxious user journeys.

- Trigger: uncertainty (“Am I doing this right?”).
- Action: ask app for diagnostic feedback.
- Reward: clear risk map + next safe step.
- Recommit: execute one stabilising action.

This loop sells calm.
Calm is sticky.

## Variation 5: identity loop

Best for habit products.

- Trigger: “I am the type of person who…” framing.
- Action: complete identity-consistent micro-task.
- Reward: streak tied to identity, not raw activity.
- Recommit: tomorrow’s pre-committed task.

People protect identity harder than checklists.

## Guardrails (non-negotiable)

Let’s be clear:
if your loop increases compulsion while reducing user agency,
you are building risk, not value.

Include:

- easy pause controls,
- transparent personalisation,
- low-friction opt-out,
- healthy usage reminders in high-intensity flows.

## Practical implementation grid

For each feature, define:

- loop type,
- intended reward,
- abuse risk,
- retention metric,
- user-wellbeing boundary.

If you cannot fill this grid,
the loop is not ready.

## The core idea

Dopamine loops are a design instrument.

Used badly: extractive engagement.
Used well: motivating progress.

Choose the latter.
It lasts longer.
