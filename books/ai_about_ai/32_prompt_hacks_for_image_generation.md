# Prompt Hacks for Image Generation

Here is the uncomfortable truth.
Most poor AI images were not model failures.
They were vague briefs dressed up as prompts.

If you want consistent results,
stop writing incantations.
Start writing art direction.

## Use a reliable prompt frame

A practical structure for **AI image generation prompts**:

1. subject,
2. scene,
3. composition,
4. lighting,
5. style cluster,
6. camera/render details,
7. negative constraints.

Keep each block short.
Concrete nouns outperform abstract adjectives.

## Constraint quality decides output quality

Weak prompt:
“Make a cool cyberpunk portrait.”

Stronger prompt:
“Waist-up portrait of a female mechanic in a rain-soaked neon alley,
35mm lens, shallow depth of field,
magenta rim light with cyan bounce,
high-detail skin texture,
editorial fashion composition,
no text, no watermark, no extra fingers.”

Specificity reduces lottery behaviour.

## Control style without copying living artists

Use descriptive style clusters:

- brutalist poster design,
- Scandinavian product photography,
- late-90s anime cel shading,
- documentary street portrait.

Avoid prompts that imitate living artists directly when policy is unclear.
I’d advise against building a workflow on legal ambiguity.

## Composition terms are low-effort leverage

If outputs feel generic,
set framing explicitly:

- rule of thirds,
- centred symmetry,
- Dutch angle,
- top-down flat lay,
- macro close-up.

Small composition clauses often create immediate differentiation.

## Lighting is the force multiplier

Many beginners had focused on subject and forgotten light.
The result was technically correct,
but emotionally flat.

Try one clear lighting intent:

- soft window light,
- hard noon shadows,
- cinematic volumetric haze,
- golden-hour backlight,
- neon key with ambient spill.

One lighting line can change everything.

## Write tactical negative prompts

Negative prompts work best when compact and purposeful.

Focus on:

- anatomical artefacts,
- text/watermarks,
- blur/noise,
- unwanted objects,
- over-stylisation.

An endless negative list can sterilise useful variation.
Use precision, not panic.

## Run a three-pass iteration loop

A dependable production cycle:

- Pass 1: concept exploration (5 variants).
- Pass 2: lock composition and lighting.
- Pass 3: refine texture/detail and clean artefacts.

Do not chase perfection on pass one.
That is expensive optimism,
not a process.

## Monetise with outcome-focused packaging

You can ship commercially valuable assets quickly:

- social content packs,
- ad concept boards,
- ebook and lead-magnet covers,
- product mockup scenes.

Clients pay for speed + relevance,
not your internal prompt poetry.

## Creative-commercial takeaway

Great **image prompting** is practical direction under constraints.

Be concrete.
Iterate deliberately.
Deliver assets that help someone publish,
sell,
or test an idea this week.
