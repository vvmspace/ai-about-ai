# Prompt Hacks for Image Generation

Let’s remove the mystique.
Great image prompts are not poetry.
They are controlled specification.

You are directing a shoot,
not whispering to a crystal ball.

## The reliable prompt frame

Use this order:

1. subject,
2. scene,
3. composition,
4. lighting,
5. style reference,
6. camera/render details,
7. negatives.

Short blocks. Clear nouns. No rambling.

## Quality jumps from concrete constraints

Weak: “A cool cyberpunk portrait.”

Stronger:
“Waist-up portrait of a female mechanic in rain-soaked neon alley,
35mm lens, shallow depth of field,
rim light magenta + cyan bounce,
high-detail skin texture,
editorial fashion composition,
no text, no watermark, no extra fingers.”

Specificity reduces lottery behaviour.

## Control style without copying artists

Prefer descriptive style clusters:

- “brutalist poster design,”
- “Scandinavian product photography,”
- “late-90s anime cel shading.”

Avoid direct living-artist mimic prompts where policy is uncertain.
That’s not a legal strategy.
That’s a headache subscription.

## Composition cheat codes

If outputs feel generic, specify framing explicitly:

- rule of thirds,
- centred symmetry,
- Dutch angle,
- top-down flat lay,
- macro close-up.

Composition terms are low effort, high impact.

## Lighting is your force multiplier

Most amateur prompts ignore light.
Professionals start there.

Try these:

- soft window light,
- hard noon shadows,
- cinematic volumetric haze,
- golden-hour backlight,
- practical neon key + ambient spill.

One lighting clause can transform the entire result.

## Negative prompts that actually help

Keep negatives tactical, not endless.

Good categories:

- anatomical artefacts,
- text/watermarks,
- blur/noise,
- unwanted objects,
- over-stylisation.

Too many negatives can flatten creativity.
Use restraint.

## Iteration loop: 3-pass method

- Pass 1: broad concept exploration (5 variants).
- Pass 2: lock composition and lighting.
- Pass 3: texture/detail polish + cleanup.

Do not perfect on pass one.
That is expensive optimism.

## Fast commercial use-cases

You can monetise quickly with:

- social post packs,
- ad concept boards,
- ebook/lead-magnet covers,
- product mockup scenes.

Delivery speed wins more contracts than artistic monologues.

## The core idea

Image prompting is applied art direction.

Be precise.
Be iterative.
Be commercially useful.

That combination beats “genius prompts” every week.
