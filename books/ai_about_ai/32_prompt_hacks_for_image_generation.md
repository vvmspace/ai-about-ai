# Prompt Hacks for Image Generation

Let’s remove the mystique.
Great image prompts are not poetry.
They are controlled specification.

You are directing a shoot,
not whispering to a crystal ball.

## The reliable prompt frame

Use this order:

1. subject,
2. scene,
3. composition,
4. lighting,
5. style cluster,
6. camera/render details,
7. negatives.

Short blocks.
Concrete nouns.
No rambling adjectives.

## Quality jumps from concrete constraints

Weak:
“A cool cyberpunk portrait.”

Stronger:
“Waist-up portrait of a female mechanic in rain-soaked neon alley,
35mm lens, shallow depth of field,
rim light magenta plus cyan bounce,
high-detail skin texture,
editorial fashion composition,
no text, no watermark, no extra fingers.”

Specificity reduces lottery behaviour.

## Control style without copying artists

Prefer descriptive style clusters:

- brutalist poster design,
- Scandinavian product photography,
- late-90s anime cel shading.

Avoid direct mimic prompts for living artists where policy is unclear.
That is not strategy.
That is risk accumulation.

## Composition cheat codes

If outputs feel generic, specify framing:

- rule of thirds,
- centred symmetry,
- Dutch angle,
- top-down flat lay,
- macro close-up.

Composition terms are low effort and high impact.

## Lighting as force multiplier

Most weak prompts ignore light.
Strong prompts start there.

Try:

- soft window light,
- hard noon shadows,
- cinematic volumetric haze,
- golden-hour backlight,
- practical neon key with ambient spill.

One lighting clause can transform the whole image.

## Negative prompts that actually help

Keep negatives tactical, not endless.

High-value categories:

- anatomical artefacts,
- text and watermarks,
- blur and noise,
- unwanted objects,
- over-stylisation.

Too many negatives flatten creativity.
Use restraint.

## The 3-pass iteration loop

- Pass 1: explore concept space (5 variants).
- Pass 2: lock composition and lighting.
- Pass 3: refine texture, colour, and defects.

Do not micro-edit pass one outputs.
Diverge first, converge later.

## Prompt versioning discipline

Store successful prompts with metadata:

- model version,
- seed (if available),
- aspect ratio,
- sampler/settings,
- intended use case.

Without prompt history, teams relearn the same lessons weekly.

## Commercial packaging basics

Clients rarely buy “an image.”
They buy decision-ready assets.

Deliver in packs:

- hero plus three alternates,
- social crop set,
- thumbnail variant,
- usage note for each file.

Specification plus packaging beats raw aesthetics.

## The core idea

Image prompting is controlled art direction under constraints.

Think like a director.
Specify like an engineer.
Iterate like a product team.
