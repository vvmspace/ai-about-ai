# Unobvious AI Use #1: The Message Doctor for Difficult Conversations

Most people do not avoid hard conversations because they are lazy.
They avoid them because wording feels dangerous.

One wrong sentence,
and a small issue becomes a week of stress.

AI can reduce that risk in minutes.

## The communication trap

You need to write one message:

- to a client who is late on payment,
- to a colleague who keeps missing deadlines,
- to a manager when capacity is broken,
- to a friend when a boundary was crossed.

You know what must be said.
You do not know how to say it without causing collateral damage.

## The practical pattern: draft -> de-risk -> send

Use AI as a communication safety layer,
not as a ghostwriter.

Three passes:

1. **Dump mode** — write your raw emotional draft.
2. **Risk mode** — ask AI to flag blame words, ambiguity, escalation triggers.
3. **Delivery mode** — generate calm, firm version with boundary + next step.

That is enough for most difficult messages.

## Prompt template (copy-paste)

"You are a communication editor.
Goal: keep message calm, firm, and clear.
Context: [insert situation].
Draft: [insert raw message].

Tasks:
1) identify risky phrasing that could trigger defensiveness,
2) rewrite in professional tone,
3) keep explicit boundary,
4) include one concrete next action and deadline,
5) keep under 140 words."

Short prompt.
High leverage.

## Why this works in real life

AI is usually better than your stressed brain at:

- reducing emotional noise,
- preserving intent,
- tightening structure,
- neutralising accidental aggression.

You remain the decision-maker.
AI handles phrasing risk.

This is especially useful when trust is already fragile.
If trust matters, language precision matters.

## Example transformation

Raw:
"You always disappear and then expect miracles from me. This is ridiculous."

Edited:
"I need us to align on timing. When inputs arrive late, delivery quality drops.
From now on, I’ll need final inputs by Tuesday 3pm to keep Thursday delivery.
If timing shifts, we should move deadlines accordingly."

Same boundary.
Less heat.
Better outcome odds.

## Three tone settings worth saving

Create reusable prompts for:

- **Professional firm** (work conflicts),
- **Warm boundary** (personal relationships),
- **Crisp legal-safe** (payment, scope, compliance).

You can also add:
"Avoid sarcasm. Avoid absolute words like always/never."

Small instruction.
Big quality jump.

## Ten-minute daily micro-routine

- Keep a folder: `difficult_messages/`.
- Save before/after versions.
- Track response quality for 2 weeks.
- Note phrases that consistently trigger pushback.

You will learn your own trigger phrases,
and gradually need less assistance.

## Where this gives unusually high ROI

- customer support escalation replies,
- payment reminders,
- performance feedback,
- saying no to scope creep,
- relationship boundary messages.

In all of these, clarity is kindness.
Vagueness is expensive.

If you are rebuilding trust systems more broadly, this chapter pairs well with [Career Strategy: Ethics and Trust](./24_career_strategy_ethics_and_trust.md).

Use AI as a **Message Doctor** for emotionally loaded communication.
Not to sound clever.
To reduce avoidable damage.

In difficult conversations, edited sentences often decide the outcome.
