# Unobvious AI Use #1: The Message Doctor for Difficult Conversations

Most people do not avoid hard conversations because they are lazy.
They avoid them because wording feels dangerous.

One wrong sentence,
and a small issue becomes a week of stress.

AI can solve this pain in minutes.

## The hidden pain

You need to write one message:

- to a client who is late on payment,
- to a colleague who keeps missing deadlines,
- to a manager when capacity is broken,
- to a friend when a boundary was crossed.

You know what must be said.
You do not know how to say it without causing collateral damage.

## The simple pattern: draft -> de-risk -> send

Use AI as a communication safety layer, not as a ghostwriter.

Three passes:

1. **Dump mode** — write your raw emotional draft.
2. **Risk mode** — ask AI to flag blame words, ambiguity, escalation triggers.
3. **Delivery mode** — generate calm, firm version with boundary + next step.

That’s it.

## Prompt template (copy-paste)

"You are a communication editor.
Goal: keep message calm, firm, and clear.
Context: [insert situation].
Draft: [insert raw message].

Tasks:
1) identify risky phrasing that could trigger defensiveness,
2) rewrite in professional tone,
3) keep explicit boundary,
4) include one concrete next action and deadline,
5) keep under 140 words."

Short prompt.
High leverage.

## Why this works

AI is better than your stressed brain at:

- reducing emotional noise,
- preserving intent,
- tightening structure,
- neutralising accidental aggression.

You stay the decision-maker.
AI handles phrasing risk.

## Example transformation

Raw:
"You always disappear and then expect miracles from me. This is ridiculous."

Edited:
"I need us to align on timing. When inputs arrive late, delivery quality drops.
From now on, I’ll need final inputs by Tuesday 3pm to keep Thursday delivery.
If timing shifts, we should move deadlines accordingly."

Same boundary.
Less heat.
Better outcome odds.

## Micro-routine for daily use

- Keep a folder: `difficult_messages/`.
- Save before/after versions.
- Track response quality for 2 weeks.

You will learn your own trigger phrases,
and gradually need less assistance.

## Where this is surprisingly valuable

- customer support escalation replies,
- payment reminders,
- performance feedback,
- “no” to scope creep,
- relationship boundary messages.

In all of these, clarity is kindness.
Vagueness is expensive.

## The core idea

Use AI as a **Message Doctor** for emotionally loaded communication.

Not to sound clever.
To reduce avoidable damage.

I’m curious how many conflicts in your week are really just unedited sentences.
