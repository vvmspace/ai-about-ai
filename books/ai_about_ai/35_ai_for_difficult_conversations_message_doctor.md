# Unobvious AI Use #1: The Message Doctor for Difficult Conversations

People rarely avoid difficult conversations because they are lazy.
They avoid them because wording feels dangerous.

One bad sentence,
and a small issue becomes a week of stress.

AI can reduce this risk in minutes.

## The hidden pain

You need to send one message:

- to a client who is late on payment,
- to a colleague who keeps missing deadlines,
- to a manager when capacity is broken,
- to a friend when a boundary was crossed.

You know what must be said.
You do not want unnecessary collateral damage.

## The simple pattern: draft -> de-risk -> send

Use AI as a communication safety layer,
not as a personality replacement.

Three passes:

1. **Dump mode** — write the raw emotional draft.
2. **Risk mode** — flag blame words, ambiguity, escalation triggers.
3. **Delivery mode** — produce calm, firm message with boundary and next step.

That is enough for most cases.

## Prompt template (copy and adapt)

"You are a communication editor.
Goal: keep message calm, firm, and clear.
Context: [insert situation].
Draft: [insert raw message].

Tasks:
1) identify risky phrasing that could trigger defensiveness,
2) rewrite in professional tone,
3) keep explicit boundary,
4) include one concrete next action and deadline,
5) keep under 140 words."

Short prompt.
High leverage.

## Why this works

AI is often better than a stressed mind at:

- reducing emotional noise,
- preserving intent,
- tightening structure,
- neutralising accidental aggression.

You remain the decision-maker.
AI handles phrasing risk.

## Example transformation

Raw:
"You always disappear and then expect miracles from me. This is ridiculous."

Edited:
"I need us to align on timing. When inputs arrive late, delivery quality drops.
From now on, I’ll need final inputs by Tuesday 3pm to keep Thursday delivery.
If timing shifts, we should move deadlines accordingly."

Same boundary.
Less heat.
Better probability of progress.

## Escalation boundaries you must set

For the avoidance of doubt,
AI should not decide your intent.

Do not outsource:

- legal admissions,
- HR-sensitive claims,
- relationship ultimatums,
- irreversible commitments.

If stakes are high,
review with a human before sending.

## Micro-routine for daily use

- Keep a folder: `difficult_messages/`.
- Save before/after versions.
- Track response quality for two weeks.

You will spot your trigger phrases,
and need less assistance over time.

## Where this is surprisingly valuable

- support escalation replies,
- payment reminders,
- performance feedback,
- saying “no” to scope creep,
- relationship boundary messages.

In each case, clarity is kindness.
Vagueness is expensive.

## The core idea

Use AI as a **Message Doctor** for emotionally loaded communication.

Not to sound clever.
To reduce avoidable damage,
and protect outcomes that matter.
