# Prompt Hacks for Video Generation

Video prompts fail for one boring reason:
people describe images,
not motion.

Motion is the product.
Everything else is support.

## The motion-first template

Structure the prompt as:

1. scene and subject,
2. action over time,
3. camera movement,
4. mood and lighting,
5. duration and pacing,
6. quality constraints and negatives.

If action is vague,
video becomes animated wallpaper.

## Write with timeline verbs

Use sequence verbs:

- enters,
- pauses,
- turns,
- accelerates,
- exits.

Example:
“Close shot of barista pouring latte art,
camera slowly dollies in,
steam rises then catches warm side light,
barista looks up and smiles at second four,
background crowd stays soft bokeh,
6 seconds, cinematic realism.”

Now the model has choreography.

## Camera language that works

Add one clear camera directive, not five:

- slow push-in,
- locked tripod,
- handheld documentary sway,
- aerial reveal,
- lateral tracking shot.

Conflicting camera instructions produce jitter and incoherence.

## Continuity safeguards

To reduce flicker and identity drift:

- keep wardrobe and props explicit,
- limit scene transitions,
- maintain one lighting setup,
- avoid unnecessary object count.

Complexity is seductive.
Consistency pays.

## Tempo and pacing control

Specify tempo words:

- deliberate,
- urgent,
- dreamy,
- staccato cuts,
- smooth cinematic flow.

Pair tempo with shot length and frame-rate guidance when supported.

## Negative prompt essentials

High-value negatives for video:

- warped limbs,
- face morphing,
- frame flicker,
- random text overlays,
- abrupt exposure shifts.

Keep the negative block short and relevant.

## Story arc in six seconds

Even short clips need narrative shape:

- setup (first second),
- change (middle),
- payoff (final beat).

Without arc, clips look expensive and forgettable.

## Production loop for usable clips

- Generate 6–10 micro-variants.
- Select top two by motion coherence.
- Upscale or extend only finalists.
- Edit captions, sound, and timing externally.

Generation is not the final product.
Packaging is where value appears.

## Quick monetisation angles

Sell outcomes, not raw clips:

- short-form ad creatives,
- social reel packs,
- product demo loops,
- explainer intros.

Clients buy conversion potential,
not your prompt archive.

## The core idea

Video prompting is direction under constraints.

Think in movement.
Edit for purpose.
Ship for business impact.
