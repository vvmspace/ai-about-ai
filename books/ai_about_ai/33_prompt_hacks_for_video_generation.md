# Prompt Hacks for Video Generation

Video prompting fails for a simple reason:
people describe a still image,
then hope motion appears by magic.

It will not.
In **AI video generation**,
motion is the product.
Everything else supports it.

## Apply a motion-first template

Use this order when writing prompts:

1. scene and subject,
2. action over time,
3. camera movement,
4. mood and lighting,
5. duration and pacing,
6. quality constraints and negatives.

If action is vague,
you get animated wallpaper,
not a usable clip.

## Write timeline verbs, not static adjectives

Sequence verbs create choreography:

- enters,
- pauses,
- turns,
- accelerates,
- exits.

Example:
“Close shot of a barista pouring latte art,
camera slowly dollies in,
steam rises then catches warm side light,
barista looks up and smiles at second 4,
background crowd remains soft bokeh,
6 seconds, cinematic realism.”

Now the model has timing,
not just aesthetics.

## Keep camera language singular and clear

Use one dominant camera directive:

- slow push-in,
- locked tripod,
- handheld documentary sway,
- aerial reveal,
- lateral tracking shot.

Multiple competing directives create jitter and incoherence.

## Protect continuity on purpose

To reduce flicker and identity drift:

- keep wardrobe and props explicit,
- minimise scene transitions,
- hold one lighting setup,
- cap object count,
- avoid unnecessary background chaos.

Complexity feels impressive.
Continuity converts.

## Control style through tempo cues

Add tempo words with intent:

- deliberate,
- urgent,
- dreamy,
- staccato,
- smooth cinematic flow.

Pair tempo with shot length and frame-rate guidance where supported.
That combination gives the model rhythm.

## Use tight, high-value negatives

For video,
these negatives usually matter most:

- warped limbs,
- face morphing,
- frame flicker,
- random text overlays,
- abrupt exposure shifts.

Keep the negative block short and relevant.
Overloaded negatives can destabilise style.

## Production loop for deliverable clips

A practical workflow:

- generate 6–10 micro-variants,
- shortlist top 2 for motion coherence,
- upscale or extend finalists only,
- finish with captions/music externally.

Generation is draft creation.
Packaging is product value.

## Monetisation angles that stay realistic

Sell outcomes,
not raw generations:

- short-form ad creatives,
- social reel packs,
- product demo loops,
- explainer intros.

Clients buy conversion potential,
not your prompt archive.

## Direction takeaway

Strong **video prompts** read like production direction under constraints.

Think in movement.
Edit with purpose.
Ship clips tied to business goals,
not to novelty.
