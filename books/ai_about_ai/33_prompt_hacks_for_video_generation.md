# Prompt Hacks for Video Generation

Video prompts fail for one boring reason:
people describe images,
not motion.

Motion is the product.
Everything else is support.

## The motion-first template

Structure your prompt as:

1. scene and subject,
2. action over time,
3. camera movement,
4. mood and lighting,
5. duration and pacing,
6. quality and negatives.

If action is vague,
video becomes animated wallpaper.

## Write with timeline verbs

Use verbs tied to sequence:

- enters,
- pauses,
- turns,
- accelerates,
- exits.

Example:
“Close shot of barista pouring latte art,
camera slowly dollies in,
steam rises then catches warm side light,
barista looks up and smiles at second 4,
background crowd remains soft bokeh,
6 seconds, cinematic realism.”

Now the model has choreography.

## Camera language that works

Add one clear camera directive, not five:

- slow push-in,
- locked tripod,
- handheld documentary sway,
- aerial reveal,
- lateral tracking shot.

Conflicting camera instructions create jitter and incoherence.

## Continuity safeguards

To reduce flicker and identity drift:

- keep wardrobe/props explicit,
- limit scene transitions,
- maintain one lighting setup,
- avoid unnecessary object count.

Complexity is seductive.
Consistency pays.

## Style and tempo control

Specify tempo words:

- deliberate,
- urgent,
- dreamy,
- staccato cuts,
- smooth cinematic flow.

Then pair with shot length and frame rate guidance when supported.

## Negative prompt essentials

For video, high-value negatives include:

- warped limbs,
- face morphing,
- frame flicker,
- random text overlays,
- abrupt exposure shifts.

Keep your negative block tight and relevant.

## Production loop for usable clips

- Generate 6–10 micro-variants.
- Select top 2 by motion coherence.
- Upscale or extend only finalists.
- Edit with captions/music externally.

Generation is not the final product.
Packaging is where value appears.

## Quick monetisation angles

Sell outcomes, not raw clips:

- short-form ad creatives,
- social reel packs,
- product demo loops,
- explainer intros.

Clients buy conversion potential,
not your prompt archive.

## The core idea

Video prompting is direction under constraints.

Think in movement.
Edit for purpose.
Ship for business impact.
