# AI about AI — Full Edition (EN)

A long-form field book for operating with AI in 2026.

## Group map

- **Prompt Engineering** (`01–05`): prompts as product assets, context discipline, instruction stacks, few-shot patterns, evaluation loops.
- **Vibe Coding** (`06–10`): idea-to-repo flow, AI pair programming, debugging, fearless refactoring, daily shipping rhythm.
- **Agents** (`11–15`): single vs multi-agent reality, tool permissions, memory/state, human-in-the-loop controls.
- **Knowledge Systems** (`16–20`): PKG thinking, practical RAG, document architecture, meeting-to-memory pipelines, searchability.
- **Career Strategy** (`21–25`): AI-native skills, leverage portfolio, brand, trust/ethics, three-year trajectory.
- **Operational Playbooks** (`26–31`): AGENTS.md as execution law, interaction protocols, agent organisations, and project-start prompt setup from operator and product angles.
- **Creator Monetisation** (`32–34`): image/video prompting tricks and the fastest route to first revenue.
- **Everyday AI Leverage** (`35–36`): unobvious, low-effort workflows that quickly remove communication and admin pain.
- **AI Products & MCP** (`37–43`): AI-driven app design, engagement mechanics, dopamine loop design, reusable skills, and practical MCP server playbooks for life and development.
- **Learning & Performance** (`44–46`): AI tutor systems, exam/interview preparation, and sustainable motivation.
- **Monetisation Sprint** (`47–48`): offer positioning and real-world outreach validation for the first paid AI service outcomes.

## Cohesive reading flow (recommended)

If you want one continuous arc (not just standalone chapters), use this sequence:

1. **Execution foundations** (`26–31`) -> set operational control for agents and project-start prompt setup.
2. **Creator execution** (`32–34`) -> apply prompt craft to image/video outputs and first monetisation.
3. **Daily utility** (`35–36`) -> apply AI to communication and personal admin pain.
4. **Product systems** (`37–38`, `43`) -> move from single features to AI-native product behaviour, engagement mechanics, and dopamine-loop design.
5. **Capability architecture** (`39–42`) -> package workflows as skills, then connect systems through MCP (build first, then domain-specific stacks).
6. **Human performance loops** (`44–46`) -> learning system design, interview/exam simulation, and motivation sustainability.
7. **Monetisation sprint** (`47–48`) -> sharpen offer positioning and validate demand through disciplined outreach.

### Transition bridges between sections

- **31 -> 32**: from project setup discipline to output production speed.
- **34 -> 35**: from external revenue use-cases to internal life/work friction removal.
- **36 -> 37**: from personal workflows to product-level AI system design.
- **38 -> 43**: from core engagement mechanics to advanced dopamine-loop variants in AI products.
- **43 -> 39**: from behavioural loops to reusable capability packaging and platform architecture.
- **42 -> 44**: from product infrastructure to human learning performance design.
- **45 -> 46**: from high-pressure performance to sustainable long-term motivation.
- **46 -> 47**: from personal execution stability to market-facing monetisation discipline.
