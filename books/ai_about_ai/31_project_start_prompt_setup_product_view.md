# Project-Start Prompt Setup (Product View)

Same project.
Different lens.

The operator asks, “Can we control execution?”
The product lead asks, “Will users care enough to return?”

You need both.
On day one.

## Start with user tension, not feature inventory

Before prompt architecture,
name one painful user tension in a single sentence.

Example:
“Users lose trust because recommendations are fast but unexplained.”

That line is not marketing copy.
It is a product constraint.

## Product narrative block

At kickoff, define four fields:

- target user segment,
- desired “aha” moment,
- unacceptable user risk,
- retention signal for week one.

If this block is absent,
teams optimise local tasks and miss product value.

## Prompt setup as UX scaffolding

Prompts shape user experience quality:

- clarity before cleverness,
- transparency before persuasion,
- useful next step before perfect answer.

If output does not help the user act,
it is not product quality.

## Two-lens acceptance criteria

Each prompt should pass two lenses:

1. **Execution lens** — accurate, safe, consistent.
2. **Value lens** — relevant, actionable, confidence-building.

Many teams pass lens one,
then quietly fail lens two.
Engagement stalls, and nobody can explain why.

## Trust moments to design deliberately

Users decide whether to trust you in tiny moments:

- when the model says “I’m not sure,”
- when the model declines a risky request,
- when the model asks one clarifying question,
- when the model cites the source of a claim.

These are not edge cases.
They are retention mechanics.

## Voice constraints at launch

Tone is part of the product surface.
Set it early.

For most professional tools:

- concise,
- calm,
- explicit about uncertainty,
- never patronising.

A technically correct answer in the wrong tone still loses trust.

## The “first 50 sessions” protocol

For early usage, log three signals per session:

- was the answer used,
- did the user ask a clarifying follow-up,
- did the user return within 24 hours.

Adjust prompts weekly using these signals,
not internal taste debates.

## Failure rehearsal before launch

Run five synthetic scenarios before opening access:

- ambiguous user objective,
- emotionally charged request,
- low-quality input data,
- policy-conflicting instruction,
- impossible deadline.

Then measure response quality by rubric.
If failure mode is fuzzy, users will discover it first.

## Practical workshop (90 minutes)

- 20 min: define user tension + aha moment.
- 20 min: draft initial prompt architecture.
- 20 min: write two-lens rubric.
- 20 min: simulate five sessions.
- 10 min: patch prompts and ship.

Fast.
Focused.
Evidence-first.

## The core idea

Project-start prompt setup is product strategy in disguise.

Treat it as technical boilerplate,
and users will feel the gap before analytics confirms it.
