# Project-Start Prompt Setup (Product View)

Same kickoff.
Different accountability.

Operators ask,
“Can this system run safely and repeatably?”
Product leaders ask,
“Will users feel real value quickly enough to come back?”

You need both answers before scaling.

## Begin with user tension, not feature enthusiasm

At kickoff, define one concrete user tension in a single sentence.

Example:
“Users receive fast recommendations, but they cannot trust them because reasoning is opaque.”

That sentence becomes your product compass.
If it is vague,
your prompt strategy will drift into output volume,
not user impact.

## Write the product narrative block

Before prompt iteration starts,
lock four product signals:

- primary user segment,
- desired “aha” moment,
- unacceptable user harm,
- week-one retention indicator.

Without this block,
teams optimise local tasks and miss the product outcome.

## Treat prompt setup as UX scaffolding

In AI-first products,
prompts are part of interface behaviour.
They shape tone, clarity, and user confidence.

Prioritise this order:

- clarity before cleverness,
- transparency before persuasion,
- useful next step before “perfect” answer,
- confidence boundaries before over-claiming.

If the user cannot act after reading the output,
that output is not product quality.

## Use two-lens acceptance criteria

Every launch prompt should pass two lenses:

1. **Execution lens** — accuracy, consistency, and safety.
2. **Value lens** — relevance, actionability, and trust lift.

Teams often pass lens one and miss lens two.
Then they wonder why engagement looks polite,
but flat.

## Define voice constraints as product decisions

Tone is not cosmetic.
It is a retention mechanic.

For most professional AI products,
set voice constraints early:

- concise,
- calm,
- direct about uncertainty,
- respectful under user frustration,
- never patronising.

A technically correct answer in the wrong voice
still damages trust.

## Run a "first 50 sessions" learning loop

Early signal beats internal opinion.
For the first 50 user sessions,
log three behavioural indicators:

- Was the answer used?
- Did the user request clarification?
- Did the user return within 24 hours?

Review weekly.
Patch prompts from behaviour,
not from meeting-room preference.

## 90-minute kickoff workshop you can repeat

Use one structured block:

- 20 min: define user tension and aha moment.
- 20 min: draft initial prompt architecture.
- 20 min: write two-lens rubric.
- 20 min: simulate five realistic sessions.
- 10 min: patch prompts and publish v1.

Fast, measurable, and hard to misinterpret.

## Product takeaway

At project start,
**prompt setup for product teams** is early strategy execution,
not merely prompt wording.

If you treat it as a technical afterthought,
users will detect it
well before dashboards do.
