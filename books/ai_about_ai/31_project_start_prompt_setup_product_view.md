# Project-Start Prompt Setup (Product View)

Same project.
Different angle.

The operator asks, “Can we control execution?”
The product lead asks, “Will users care?”

You need both.

## Start with user tension, not feature list

Before prompt design,
name one painful user tension in a single sentence.

Example:
“Users lose trust because recommendations are fast but unexplained.”

That sentence should shape every prompt decision afterwards.

## Product narrative block

At kickoff, define:

- target user segment,
- desired user moment (“aha” event),
- unacceptable user risk,
- retention signal in week one.

Without this block,
you optimise local tasks and miss product value.

## Prompt setup as UX scaffolding

Prompts should guide experience quality:

- clarity before cleverness,
- transparency before persuasion,
- useful next step before perfect answer.

If output cannot help the user act,
it is not product quality.

## Two-lens acceptance criteria

Each prompt should pass:

1. **Execution lens** — accurate, safe, consistent.
2. **Value lens** — relevant, actionable, confidence-building.

Teams often pass lens one and fail lens two.
Then they wonder why engagement is flat.

## Voice constraints at launch

Tone is a product component.
Set it early.

For most professional tools:

- concise,
- calm,
- explicit about uncertainty,
- never patronising.

A sharp answer in the wrong tone still loses trust.

## The “first 50 sessions” protocol

For early usage,
log three signals per session:

- was the answer used,
- did user ask clarifying follow-up,
- did user return within 24 hours.

Adjust prompts weekly from these signals,
not from internal taste debates.

## Practical workshop (90 minutes)

- 20 min: define user tension + aha event.
- 20 min: write initial prompt architecture.
- 20 min: create two-lens rubric.
- 20 min: simulate five user sessions.
- 10 min: patch prompts and ship.

Fast, focused, evidence-first.

## The core idea

Prompt setup at project start is product strategy in disguise.

If you treat it as a technical afterthought,
users will feel it before analytics confirms it.
