# Ship Small, Daily, and Public

Most people overestimate what they can **ship** in one heroic weekend,
and underestimate what they can build in 90 focused minutes every day.

The difference is not talent.
It is cadence.

Daily small shipping is where AI becomes career leverage instead of occasional entertainment.

## Why daily shipping works in the AI era

AI compresses build time.
What remains scarce is decision quality, feedback quality, and consistency.

A daily shipping habit creates all three:

- you decide under real constraints,
- you receive fast external signal,
- you build trust through visible follow-through.

In 2026, “build in public with AI” is no longer niche creator advice.
It is a practical professional growth strategy.

## The minimum shippable unit (MSU)

Define an MSU you can finish in 60–90 minutes.

Examples:

- one improved onboarding screen,
- one cleaner error state,
- one automation script for repetitive task,
- one measurable prompt improvement.

If an item cannot fit inside MSU, split it.

Ambition without slicing produces backlog theatre.

## Daily cadence template

### Monday: commitment
Publish what you intend to ship this week (small and concrete).

### Tuesday–Thursday: execution
Ship one MSU per day, each with a short note:
- what changed,
- why it matters,
- what remains uncertain.

### Friday: synthesis
Publish weekly log:
- wins,
- failures,
- metrics,
- next bets.

This rhythm compounds reputation and clarity.

## Public does not mean polished

Many people avoid publishing because output feels incomplete.

But public iteration is about transparency, not perfection.

Useful update format:

- “Today I tried X.”
- “It failed because Y.”
- “Tomorrow I will test Z.”

Honest progress attracts better collaborators than polished silence.

## Metrics that matter (and those that don’t)

Vanity metrics:
- likes,
- impressions,
- applause from strangers.

Signal metrics:
- number of users who reused your artifact,
- quality of feedback received,
- cycle-time reduction in your workflow,
- inbound opportunities with context.

Measure signal.
Ignore noise.

## Field example: internal automation portfolio

An operations manager started daily shipping tiny automations:

- day 1: file naming normaliser,
- day 2: meeting summary formatter,
- day 3: duplicate ticket detector,
- day 4: escalation triage template,
- day 5: weekly status generator.

None looked glamorous.

In two months, those public logs became evidence of leverage.
That evidence led to a larger role redesign and budget ownership.

Small daily outputs became career gravity.

## Anti-patterns

### 1) Weekly overplanning
Spending more time planning than shipping.

### 2) Secret progress
Building in private indefinitely, denying yourself feedback.

### 3) Inconsistent cadence
Shipping five things one week, then disappearing for three.

### 4) No review loop
Without weekly reflection, daily output turns into random motion.

## Practical drill: 14-day shipping sprint

For two weeks:

1. define one MSU per weekday,
2. ship publicly each day,
3. include one sentence on uncertainty,
4. track one signal metric,
5. run Friday retrospective.

At the end, evaluate:
- what improved in your decision speed,
- what attracted meaningful feedback,
- which workflows deserve deeper investment.

## The long game

Daily shipping builds more than output.
It builds identity.

You stop being “someone with ideas.”
You become “someone who makes useful things repeatedly.”

That identity is hard to imitate and easy to trust.

Keep this line in sight:

**Big breakthroughs are usually stacked small releases wearing a trench coat.**
