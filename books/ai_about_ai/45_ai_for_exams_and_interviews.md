# AI for Exam and Interview Preparation

Most candidates prepare by consuming content.
High performers prepare by simulating pressure.

AI is excellent for that.

## The real pain

People often fail not from ignorance,
but from execution breakdown:

- time pressure,
- blank moments,
- weak answer structure,
- inability to adapt to follow-up questions.

Preparation must train performance, not just memory.

## Exam prep loop

Use AI for four phases:

1. syllabus decomposition,
2. question generation by difficulty,
3. timed answer simulation,
4. error taxonomy and fix plan.

Your weak-point map should update every session.

## Interview prep loop

Run mock interviews with constraints:

- role + level + company context,
- behavioural + technical mix,
- probing follow-ups,
- scoring rubric.

Then request:

- what was strong,
- what was vague,
- where evidence was missing,
- one improved answer version.

## Prompt template (exam)

"You are my exam coach for [subject].
Generate 12 questions: 4 basic, 4 intermediate, 4 advanced.
Run a timed session.
After each answer, grade with rubric (accuracy, structure, speed).
Track recurring errors and give a 3-day repair plan."

## Prompt template (interview)

"Act as interviewer for [role].
Ask one question at a time.
Challenge weak answers with follow-up.
Score each response 1–10 on clarity, relevance, and evidence.
At the end, produce: top 3 fixes, better phrasing, and a 30-minute drill plan."

## Tactical frameworks that help immediately

For behavioural answers:

- STAR (Situation, Task, Action, Result),
- CAR (Challenge, Action, Result).

For technical answers:

- clarify assumptions,
- explain trade-offs,
- conclude with recommendation.

Structure reduces panic.

## The core idea

AI preparation is powerful when it mimics real pressure and gives precise correction.

Status -> simulate conditions.
Boundary -> demand evidence, not fluff.
Consequence -> performance improves where it counts.
