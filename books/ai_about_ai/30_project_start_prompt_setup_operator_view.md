# Project-Start Prompt Setup (Operator View)

Day one of a project is not for inspiration.
It is for reducing future chaos.

Prompt setup at launch is operational architecture.
Do it once, correctly,
and you buy back weeks.

## The operator’s objective

An operator cares about three things:

- predictable output,
- controllable risk,
- measurable cost.

Prompt setup should be judged on these,
not on how clever it sounds.

## Start packet: the non-negotiable five

Before any generation sprint, build a start packet:

1. **Mission brief** — outcome, user, deadline.
2. **Constraints ledger** — legal, technical, brand, policy.
3. **Reference canon** — source hierarchy and trust levels.
4. **Output schemas** — what “done” physically looks like.
5. **Evaluation rubric** — pass/fail dimensions.

Missing packet = drifting scope by lunch.

## Environment assumptions block

Force explicit assumptions early:

- stack and versions,
- deployment context,
- budget envelope,
- available tools,
- excluded dependencies.

I’m curious how many project delays are simply unstated environment reality.

## Prompt architecture for launch week

Use a three-layer stack:

- **System layer**: role, boundaries, tone constraints.
- **Task layer**: current objective and acceptance criteria.
- **State layer**: known decisions and open questions.

Lock system layer.
Version task and state layers daily.

## Gate prompts, not only outputs

Most teams review outputs.
Smarter teams also review prompts.

Add two checks:

- ambiguity score (how many interpretations remain),
- dependency score (what external facts can break this).

If either score is high,
revise the prompt before scaling execution.

## Incident-resistant defaults

Set calm defaults from day one:

- ask for citations on factual claims,
- surface uncertainty explicitly,
- decline unsupported legal/medical/financial certainty,
- escalate when constraints conflict.

This prevents “confident nonsense” from becoming process debt.

## Launch checklist (15 minutes)

- Mission and constraints present.
- Schema and rubric linked.
- Source hierarchy defined.
- Escalation triggers clear.
- First dry run scored by rubric.

Then proceed.

## The core idea

Project-start prompt setup is not writing prompts.
It is setting control surfaces.

Get control surfaces right,
and delivery stops feeling lucky.
