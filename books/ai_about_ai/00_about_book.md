# AI about AI — 2026 Field Guide

This book is written for one purpose: helping a normal, ambitious human work with modern AI like a seasoned operator rather than a confused button-clicker.

In 2026, the gap is no longer between “people who use AI” and “people who don’t”. The gap is between:

- people who can instruct, evaluate, and orchestrate AI systems;
- and people who still treat AI as a chat toy.

If you are here, you chose the better camp.

## How to read this book

Each chapter is designed to do five things without announcing the structure:

1. hit you with a surprising truth;
2. hold your attention with a practical puzzle;
3. give you a clear takeaway;
4. turn it into immediate action;
5. leave you with momentum.

The chapters are grouped by practical themes: Prompt Engineering, Vibe Coding, Agents, Knowledge Systems, and Career Strategy.

Expect plain English, sharp examples, and memorable phrases you can repeat in meetings.

A simple rule runs through the entire book:

> AI is not magic. It is leverage.

Use leverage wisely, and your output multiplies.
