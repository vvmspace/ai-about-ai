# My 90-Second Story: Senior Engineer, Clear Business Impact

When they say, “Tell me about yourself,” they are usually asking three things.
Can you deliver.
Can you prioritise.
Can we trust your judgement when pressure rises.

So I answer in that order.

I’ve been building production systems for 17+ years across backend-heavy and full-stack teams.
In recent years I’ve focused on Node.js, NestJS, React, and Next.js, with TypeScript as the default working language.
My strongest pattern is turning ambiguous product goals into reliable delivery plans.

Most recently, at FrieNDA, I had operated as Lead Core Developer and covered Acting CTO duties.
I worked on architecture, model choice, and agentic workflow design.
We integrated AI capabilities into core product paths rather than side demos.
I also tightened CI/CD and AWS operations so releases became predictable.

Before that, I helped build an OpenAI-based matching system from early experimentation into production.
The work included embeddings pipelines, ranking logic, and frontend integration.
The practical outcome was faster matching quality improvements with a clear release cadence.

Earlier, I led backend delivery on a high-load digital document platform.
We handled e-signature and eKYC flows where errors were expensive.
The technical focus was throughput, reliability, and auditability.
The business focus was trust.

Across roles, my method has stayed consistent.
Frame the constraint.
Design for change.
Measure what matters.

I use AI tools daily—Cursor, Windsurf, Codex, model APIs—but with guardrails.
I delegate drafting and exploration.
I do not delegate final architecture judgement.
I treat prompts as executable specifications and verification as mandatory.

I’m also direct about growth areas.
Modern React state management had been my weakest edge compared with backend architecture depth.
So I’ve been running a focused reset: Redux Toolkit, Zustand, React Query, and practical trade-off drills.
The gap is now structured work, not vague concern.

If we’re being precise, what I bring is not just code output.
I bring stable decision-making.
I can lead implementation, reduce uncertainty, and keep teams moving without drama.

That is usually enough for a strong first pass.
Then I move to evidence.


If the conversation turns to AI-native engineering depth, I make the core principles explicit first: I treat agent instructions as execution contracts, which means scope, constraints, and acceptance criteria are written before work starts.
And I design tool access and permission boundaries up front, because fast systems without safety controls create expensive incidents.
If needed, I can reference the long-form framing in [agents as execution contracts](../ai_about_ai/26_agentsmd_as_execution_contract.md) and [agent tools, permissions, and safety](../ai_about_ai/13_agents_tools_permissions_safety.md).
