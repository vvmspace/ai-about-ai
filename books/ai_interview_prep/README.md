# AI Interview Prep — Table of Contents

A short, first-person prep book I can run through in under 12 hours before a Full-Stack + AI-first interview.
I write it as my own technical autobiography under pressure: what I already do well, where I am still weaker, and how I close that gap before the call.

## Contents

1. **[00. The Night Before: I Stop Performing and Start Positioning](./00_the_night_before_stop_performing_start_positioning.md)**
   I begin with the exact moment I stop trying to impress and start trying to match the role with evidence. I set one hard rule for myself: every claim must map to a shipped outcome, not a clever phrase.

2. **[01. My 90-Second Story: Senior Engineer, Clear Business Impact](./01_my_90_second_story_senior_engineer_clear_business_impact.md)**
   I compress 17+ years into one sharp narrative that covers architecture, delivery speed, and leadership under constraints. The result is a confident answer to “Tell me about yourself” that sounds grounded, not rehearsed.

3. **[02. React State Management Reset: From Weak Spot to Competitive Edge](./02_react_state_management_reset_from_weak_spot_to_competitive_edge.md)**
   I face my weakest area directly: state management in React under real product pressure. I rebuild the fundamentals—local vs global state, server state, derived state, and side effects—then practise interview answers around Redux Toolkit, Zustand, React Query, and when not to use each, with practical code-level examples and trade-off stories.

4. **[03. Next.js Frontend Scenarios: Hydration, Caching, and UI Stability](./03_nextjs_frontend_scenarios_hydration_caching_ui_stability.md)**
   I prepare for likely frontend follow-ups: SSR/ISR decisions, hydration mismatches, rendering performance, and data-fetching trade-offs. I answer in a simple pattern—problem, decision, trade-off, result—so my thinking stays crisp.

5. **[04. Node.js and NestJS: How I Structure Backends That Survive Change](./04_nodejs_nestjs_how_i_structure_backends_that_survive_change.md)**
   I organise my backend experience into reusable stories about module boundaries, validation, error handling, and observability. I include direct, interview-safe explanations for REST vs GraphQL, plus how I debug production issues without drama.

6. **[05. System Architecture in Plain Terms: Time, Cost, Risk](./05_system_architecture_in_plain_terms_time_cost_risk.md)**
   I translate complex system design into language both engineering leads and product stakeholders trust. I explain where I choose microservices, where I keep a modular monolith, and how I make consistency and latency trade-offs explicit.

7. **06. AI Agents in Daily Development: My Real Workflow**
   I show exactly how I use Cursor, Windsurf, Codex, and model APIs to design, write, refactor, and test code faster. I also show boundaries: context windows, memory hygiene, verification loops, and the decisions I never delegate.

8. **07. Prompt Engineering for Engineers: Patterns That Cut Rework**
   I collect practical prompt templates for bug triage, feature scaffolding, and code review. I explain why prompt structure changes output quality, defect rate, and review speed in measurable ways.

9. **08. CI/CD and Docker Discipline: How I Keep Releases Boring**
   I prepare stories on pipelines, rollback paths, environment parity, and production safety checks. The chapter gives me calm, specific language for reliability questions that often decide senior-level interviews.

10. **09. Databases Under Load: PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and Query Thinking**
    I revisit schema choices, indexing strategy, query plans, and read/write trade-offs from systems I had operated at scale. I tie each technical decision to business impact, so answers land with both depth and relevance.

11. **10. LLM API Integration and RAG: From Prototype to Production**
    I prepare for modern AI-first expectations: model choice, vector retrieval, evaluation loops, and guardrails. I describe how I moved from experiments to stable product features with predictable cost and quality.

12. **11. Gap-Closure Sprint: My 30-Day Plan After the Offer**
    I turn uncertainty into a plan: what I had lacked, what I prioritise first, and how I report progress by week. This makes “I don’t know yet” sound like ownership rather than weakness.

13. **12. Mock Interview Gauntlet: 50 Questions with Tight Answers**
    I finish with rapid drills across React state management, Node.js architecture, AI-agent workflows, and leadership behaviour. By the end I can feel the match increase, because my answers now sound like delivery evidence, not hope.
