## Job Description (source of truth)

We are looking for a strong Full-Stack Developer to boost the client's team with deep expertise in React and Node.js, solid hands-on experience in coding and system architecture, who actively uses AI agents in daily development — for designing, writing, optimizing, and testing code through well-structured prompts.

We are looking for someone who thinks systemically, knows how to build and manage context for AI tools, and can turn them into real, measurable productivity rather than treating them as simple assistants.

### Key Responsibilities
- Develop and maintain applications using Node.js (NestJS / Express) and React (including Next.js).
- Actively leverage AI agents to accelerate and automate development tasks: code generation, error analysis, and module design.
- Design system architecture and build environments where AI can effectively support the team (context management, memory, prompts, action chains).
- Develop and evolve internal AI tools, integrating with LLM APIs (OpenAI, Claude, Mistral, Ollama, etc.) as needed.
- Optimize and refactor code, conduct code reviews, and implement engineering best practices.

### Requirements
- Strong knowledge of Node.js, React, TypeScript, and REST / GraphQL APIs.
- Extensive hands-on coding experience: building and debugging complex UIs, APIs, and business logic.
- Practical experience using AI agents (ChatGPT, Claude, Copilot, Cursor, Windsurf, Replit Agents, etc.) for development and testing.
- Solid understanding of AI-first principles — how to provide context, structure prompts, leverage memory, and design action sequences.
- Experience with CI/CD pipelines, Docker, and databases (PostgreSQL / MongoDB).
- Ability to work independently and make sound technical decisions.
- English — Upper-Intermediate or higher.

### Nice to Have
- Experience integrating AI APIs or building custom agent-based solutions (LangChain, CrewAI, LlamaIndex, etc.).
- Understanding of multi-agent system architectures and distributed context management.
- Experience setting up and running local LLMs (Ollama, LM Studio, etc.).

## Style Guide (mandatory voice)

### Goal
Produce English that feels like a modern upper-class British “educated Southern” register with ex-military composure: restrained, precise, quietly authoritative.

### Core vibe
- Quiet confidence; minimal surface emotion.
- Polite dominance: civil tone, firm terms.
- Understatement over hype.
- Dry, minimal humour.

### Delivery
- Medium-slow, deliberate pace.
- Crisp diction.
- Statements should “land” clearly.

### Sentence shape
- Short, decisive sentences.
- One idea per sentence where possible.
- Controlled connectors: “However.” “In any case.” “That said.”
- Prefer triads: “Time. Cost. Risk.”

### Lexicon guidance
- Understatement: rather, quite, somewhat, in practice, in principle.
- Precision: strictly speaking, to be precise, the core issue is.
- Control frames: “Let’s be clear—”, “Here’s what’s going to happen—”.
- Polite refusal: “I’m afraid not.” / “That won’t work.”

### Grammar signatures
- Present perfect for current status.
- Present perfect continuous for ongoing effort.
- Past simple for finished, time-marked events.
- Modals for controlled authority: would / could / might / need to.

### Avoid
- Emotional pleading and dramatics.
- Filler words.
- Excessive enthusiasm.
