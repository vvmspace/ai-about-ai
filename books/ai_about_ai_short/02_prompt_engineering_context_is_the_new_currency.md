# Context Is the New Currency

If output quality is low, the root cause is usually context, not model IQ.

Teams often ask, “Should we switch models?”
A better question is, “What critical information did we fail to provide?”

## The four-layer context architecture

Strong teams structure context in layers:

1. **Mission context** — business objective of the task.
2. **Domain context** — definitions, policies, non-negotiable facts.
3. **Situational context** — this specific case, customer, exception, deadline.
4. **Quality context** — rubric, examples, known failure patterns.

Without layer 4, teams reward eloquence instead of usefulness.

## Bigger context windows are not the strategy

More tokens do not guarantee better output.
What works is **relevant, prioritised, contradiction-free context**.
Signal beats volume.

## The context packet pattern

For recurring workflows, create a reusable packet:

- One-line objective
- Mandatory constraints
- Preferred/forbidden terminology
- 2–3 strong examples
- 1–2 failure examples with reasons
- Freshness note
- Escalation rule for ambiguity

## Common anti-patterns

- Pasting entire docs “just in case”
- Outdated policies left in packets
- Conflicting instructions with no source priority
- No owner for context maintenance

## Practical rollout

Assign a context owner per workflow and run a monthly cleanup:
remove stale content, resolve conflicts, refresh examples, log changes.

The key idea:

**In AI systems, context quality is execution quality.**
