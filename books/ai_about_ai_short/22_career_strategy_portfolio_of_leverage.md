# Build a Portfolio of Leverage

A traditional CV answers one question:
“What did you do?”

A leverage portfolio answers a better one:
“What can you improve repeatedly, under constraints, with evidence?”

## Why resumes are losing explanatory power

Resumes compress years into bullet points.
Useful, but limited.

They rarely show:

- process quality,
- decision logic,
- adaptation after failure,
- measurable before/after outcomes.

## What belongs in a leverage portfolio

A strong portfolio item includes five blocks:

1. starting problem,
2. constraints,
3. intervention,
4. measurement,
5. iteration (what failed and how you corrected it).

Without block five, credibility drops.

## Portfolio categories that signal AI-native value

Build diverse evidence across categories:

- prompt system with evaluation logs,
- automation workflow reducing repetitive effort,
- decision-support tool with measurable adoption,
- quality-control framework for AI outputs,
- onboarding playbook that reduced ramp time.

## Metrics that make portfolio items believable

Prefer operational metrics:

- cycle time reduction,
- revision count reduction,
- error-rate decrease,
- throughput increase,
- cost avoided.

The key idea:

**A CV describes your past. A leverage portfolio makes your future impact legible.**
