# Refactor Without Fear

Fear in refactoring is rarely irrational.

## Refactor goals must be explicit

A dangerous **refactor** starts with vague intent:

- behaviour must remain unchanged,
- public interfaces must stay stable (or be migration-documented),

## The safety envelope

Before any AI-assisted change, define a safety envelope document.

- module boundaries in scope,
- banned changes,

## Slice refactoring beats big-bang refactoring

Ask AI for a staged plan, not one massive diff.

## Prompting AI for safer refactors

Weak prompt:
“Refactor this file.”
