# AI-Native Skills for 2026

There is a polite myth still circulating in professional circles:

## The real divide

The market divide is no longer between:

- people who use AI,
- and people who do not.

## What “AI-native skill” actually means

AI-native skill is not memorising model trivia.

## Why this matters for hiring and promotion

Hiring managers in 2026 increasingly test for applied leverage, not tool familiarity.

- Can you reduce cycle time without lowering quality?
- Can you design human+AI workflows that survive edge cases?

## Skill 1 in practice: framing as force multiplier

Weak framing:
“Make this report better.”
