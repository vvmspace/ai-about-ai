# Designing Multi-Agent Workflows

Most multi-agent projects fail in the same way:
not because models are weak,
but because handoffs are vague.

## Orchestration is workflow engineering

A multi-agent system is not “many chats.”
It is a pipeline of commitments.

- expected artefact,
- acceptance criteria,

## Start from deliverables, not roles

Teams often begin with role names: researcher, writer, reviewer.

## Handoff contracts: the missing layer

Each inter-agent handoff should include a structured contract:

- payload schema,
- confidence score,

## Communication format matters

Free-form text is human-friendly but machine-ambiguous.

- human-readable summary,
- machine-readable JSON block.
