# How to Treat AI Like a Pair Programmer

Most disappointing AI coding sessions begin with a category error.

## What strong pair programming actually means

In human pairing, quality comes from constant micro-feedback:

- intent is explicit,
- trade-offs are discussed,

## The pairing contract

Before touching code, set a short contract.

- architecture,
- product trade-offs,

## A practical loop that works

Use 10–15 minute cycles:

## Prompts that improve engineering quality

Weak: “Implement user auth.”
