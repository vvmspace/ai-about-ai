# Ship Small, Daily, and Public

Most people overestimate what they can **ship** in one heroic weekend,
and underestimate what they can build in 90 focused minutes every day.

## Why daily shipping works in the AI era

AI compresses build time.

- you decide under real constraints,
- you receive fast external signal,

## The minimum shippable unit (MSU)

Define an MSU you can finish in 60–90 minutes.

- one improved onboarding screen,
- one cleaner error state,

## Daily cadence template

This rhythm compounds reputation and clarity.

- what changed,
- why it matters,

## Public does not mean polished

Many people avoid publishing because output feels incomplete.

- “Today I tried X.”
- “It failed because Y.”
