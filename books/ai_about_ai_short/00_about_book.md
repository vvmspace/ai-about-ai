# AI about AI — 2026 Field Guide

This short edition is the rapid field manual for people who need practical AI leverage without wading through the full long-form chapters.

You will still follow the same five-part architecture of the main book: Prompt Engineering, Vibe Coding, Agents, Knowledge Systems, and Career Strategy.

Each chapter in this edition is compressed to essentials: what changed, what breaks in real life, what to do next, and where to go deeper in the full edition.

Use this version when you need velocity. Use the full version when you need depth, nuance, and complete operating playbooks.
