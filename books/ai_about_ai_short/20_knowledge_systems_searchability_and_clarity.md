# Searchability Is a Leadership Skill

When teams cannot find trusted information quickly,
they do not have a search problem.
They have a leadership systems problem.

## The hidden tax of poor searchability

If a team spends minutes (or hours) locating policy, decisions, or specs,
that cost compounds across salaries, delays, rework, and avoidable mistakes.

Typical signals:

- repeated “where is the latest version?” questions,
- contradictory docs in circulation,
- onboarding drag,
- decision latency.

## Searchability starts with information architecture

Core leadership responsibilities:

- define canonical naming conventions,
- enforce one source of truth per topic,
- label document status clearly,
- assign owners and review dates.

Without this hygiene, even great retrieval tools return confusion faster.

## Naming and metadata are operational controls

Good naming should encode:

- domain,
- artefact type,
- scope,
- status/version.

Mandatory metadata for operational docs:

- owner,
- status,
- review date,
- canonical URL/id,
- tags/taxonomy.

## Practical governance loop

Run monthly:

1. review failed search queries,
2. archive obsolete docs,
3. merge duplicate sources,
4. reassign orphaned ownership.

The key idea:

**Searchability is not an IT feature. It is a leadership discipline for execution quality.**
