# Searchability Is a Leadership Skill

When teams cannot find trusted information quickly,
they do not have a search problem.

## The hidden tax of poor searchability

If a team spends minutes (or hours) locating policy, decisions, or specs,
that cost compounds across salaries, delays, rework, and avoidable mistakes.

- repeated “where is the latest version?” questions,
- contradictory docs in circulation,

## Searchability starts with information architecture

Core leadership responsibilities:

- define canonical naming conventions,
- enforce one source of truth per topic,

## Naming conventions are strategic, not cosmetic

- domain,
- artefact type,

## Metadata standards that make search work

Mandatory metadata for operational docs:

- owner,
- status,
